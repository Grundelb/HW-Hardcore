Hey little girl on your way to class
Loved by all cause you got that ass
Cutest eyes and the greatest smile
For a year for a time for a little while
Somebody told me that you got old
Looking for someone thats made of gold
Hey little girl on your way to class
In a year they'll be gone cause you are an ass
No one's gonna love you when you're old
Thats what they told you better stay young baby
No one's gonna care when you are gone
So if you're done you better die young baby
Hey little girl on your way to prom
One little night then your life is gone
All that you had is a fairytale
Now you're standing alone wonder why did you fail
Somebody told me that you're ok
Somebody told me you passed away
Life aint coming back for you
No one's gonna love you when you're old
Thats what they told you better stay young baby
No one's gonna care when you are gone
So if you're done you better die young baby
