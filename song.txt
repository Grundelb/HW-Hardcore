You are in pain
Take your life, take your life with cocaine
But I am who I am
So I do what I can, when I can
But I can't really do a damn thing!

So fine this day
All your problems has gone away
But tomorrow, when you wake up
All your problems are back to stay

Your life, a game
Turn it up, turn it up with cocaine
And everytime that you live is a time when you feel
And the only time you heal
